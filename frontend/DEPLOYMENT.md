# CarGuessr React Migration - Deployment Guide

## ✅ Migration Complete!

The CarGuessr frontend has been successfully migrated from static HTML/JS to React + TypeScript + Vite with **full feature parity**.

## 🎯 What's Been Accomplished

### Complete Feature Parity
✅ All 3 game modes (Challenge, Streak, Stay at Zero)
✅ Difficulty selection (Easy/Hard)
✅ Car display with image gallery
✅ Price input with slider
✅ Result and game over modals
✅ Leaderboard system with score submission
✅ Full authentication system (login, register, password reset)
✅ User profiles with statistics
✅ Friend challenges (create, join, resume)
✅ Challenge leaderboards
✅ My Challenges management
✅ Toast notifications
✅ Mobile responsive design
✅ SEO meta tags and structured data

### Infrastructure
✅ TypeScript type safety throughout
✅ Zustand state management
✅ Complete API client with all endpoints
✅ Custom hooks for authentication
✅ Component-based architecture
✅ Vite build system (fast HMR)
✅ Go server updated to serve React build
✅ CORS configured for development and production

## 🚀 Running the Application

### Development Mode

1. **Start the Go backend** (in project root):
   ```bash
   cd /Users/adarssh/Documents/vibe/carguessr
   go run cmd/server/main.go
   ```
   Backend will run on http://localhost:8080

2. **Start the React frontend** (in separate terminal):
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```
   Frontend will run on http://localhost:5173

3. **Access the app**: http://localhost:5173
   - API calls will be proxied to the Go backend automatically
   - Hot Module Replacement (HMR) enabled for instant updates

### Production Mode

1. **Build the React app**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run build
   ```
   - Output will be in `../dist` directory
   - Assets are optimized and minified

2. **Start the Go server**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/adarssh/Documents/vibe/carguessr
   go run cmd/server/main.go
   ```
   - Server will serve the React build from `dist/`
   - Access at http://localhost:8080

## 🔧 Configuration

### Vite Configuration
- API proxy: `/api` → `http://localhost:8080`
- Static proxy: `/static` → `http://localhost:8080`
- Build output: `../dist`

### Go Server Configuration
- Serves React app from `dist/` directory
- SPA routing: All non-API routes serve `index.html`
- CORS: Configured for both dev (5173) and prod (8080) ports
- Static assets: `/assets`, `/css`, `/images`, `/favicon_io`

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Build Errors
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run build
```

### CORS Issues
- Ensure Go server is running on port 8080
- Check `cmd/server/main.go` CORS configuration
- Verify frontend proxy in `vite.config.ts`

### Hot Module Replacement Not Working
```bash
# Restart Vite dev server
npm run dev
```

### Static Assets Not Loading
- Check that assets are in `dist/` after build
- Verify Go server static routes in `main.go`
- Check browser console for 404 errors

## 📊 Performance

### Build Stats
- Production bundle size: ~259 KB (gzipped: ~76 KB)
- CSS bundle size: ~37 KB (gzipped: ~7.4 KB)
- Build time: ~550ms

### Runtime Performance
- Fast page loads with code splitting
- Optimized React components
- Efficient state management with Zustand
- API calls cached when appropriate

## 🔐 Security

- TypeScript prevents many runtime errors
- Input validation on all forms
- Secure authentication with JWT tokens
- XSS protection with React's built-in escaping
- CORS properly configured
- Rate limiting on backend

## 📝 Key Changes from Static Version

1. **State Management**: Global variables → Zustand stores
2. **Rendering**: DOM manipulation → React components
3. **Types**: No types → Full TypeScript coverage
4. **Build Process**: No build → Vite build system
5. **Routing**: Manual → SPA with client-side routing
6. **Events**: Window events → React synthetic events + custom events
7. **Styling**: Direct DOM → React className

## 🎓 Development Tips

1. **Add New Components**: Follow existing patterns in `components/`
2. **Add New API Calls**: Extend `api/client.ts`
3. **Add New State**: Extend stores in `stores/`
4. **Add New Types**: Update `types/index.ts`
5. **Custom Events**: Use for modal triggers (see existing pattern)

## 🚀 Deployment to Production

1. **Build the frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Test the production build locally**:
   ```bash
   cd ..
   go run cmd/server/main.go
   # Visit http://localhost:8080
   ```

3. **Deploy**:
   - Commit the changes to Git
   - Push to your server
   - Build the frontend on the server
   - Run the Go server
   - Configure your reverse proxy (nginx/Apache) if needed
