# Motors Price Guesser Game ðŸš—ðŸ’¸

A fun web-based game where players guess the prices of real cars from Motors.co.uk listings. Built with Go/Gin backend and vanilla JavaScript frontend.

## Features

- **Real Motors.co.uk data** - Live car listings with actual prices, images, and details
- **Fast scraping** - Data extracted directly from search results (no detail page navigation)
- **Headless operation** - Runs silently without opening browser windows
- Two game modes:
  - **Stay at Zero**: Accumulate the lowest total price difference
  - **Streak Mode**: Guess within 10% of the actual price or game over
- Beautiful, responsive UI with clean car details
- Real car images from Motors CDN
- Direct links to original Motors.co.uk listings

## Quick Start

### Using Make (Recommended)
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd autotraderguesser
make setup    # Install dependencies and generate docs
make run      # Start the server
```

### Manual Setup
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd autotraderguesser
go mod download
go run cmd/server/main.go
```

Open your browser to `http://localhost:8080`

The game automatically fetches real car data from Motors.co.uk (takes 5-10 seconds on first load). If scraping fails, it falls back to sample data.

## Game Modes

### ðŸŽ¯ Stay at Zero
- Start with a score of 0
- Each guess adds the absolute difference to your score
- Goal: Keep your cumulative score as low as possible

### ðŸ”¥ Streak Mode  
- Guess within 10% of the actual price to continue
- Each correct guess adds 1 to your streak
- One wrong guess ends the game

## Example Real Cars

From live Motors.co.uk data:
- **2018 Hyundai TUCSON** - Â£8,495 (63k miles, 1.6L Petrol, Manual, SUV)

- **2016 BMW X3** - Â£6,495 (103k miles, 2L Diesel, Manual, SUV)

## Development

The scraper uses Go Rod for headless browser automation to extract car data from Motors.co.uk search results. It includes:

- **Variety**: Searches different UK locations for diverse car listings
- **Data extraction**: Make, model, year, price, engine size, mileage, fuel type, transmission, body type
- **Image handling**: Extracts real car images from Motors CDN
- **Error handling**: Falls back to sample data if scraping fails
- **Performance**: Fast extraction from search results page (no detail page navigation)

## Troubleshooting

**Server won't start?**
```bash
make kill  # Kill any running instances
make run   # Start fresh
```

**No cars loading?**
- Browser automation may take 5-10 seconds on first run
- Check network connection to Motors.co.uk
- Server automatically falls back to sample data if scraping fails

**Want to see what cars are loaded?**
```bash
make check-listings
```
