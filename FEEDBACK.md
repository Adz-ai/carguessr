# User Feedback & Implementation Status

## Mobile/UX Issues âœ… FIXED
- âœ… **The CSS on phones might need touching up cause I can scroll left to right on iPhone 13 pro** - Fixed horizontal scroll issues on mobile
- âœ… **It's fun, one recommendation is on mobile maybe make the main image aspect ratio 16:9 or the original aspect ratio as the square aspect ratio kinda cuts some images off** - Changed to 4:3 aspect ratio to prevent image cropping
- âœ… **Leaderboard modal fixes** - Fixed close button accessibility, prevented background scrolling, improved mobile layout

## Game Logic Issues âœ… FIXED  
- âœ… **Only issue is within 4-5 guesses it rotated in the first car again, aside from that cool game** - Implemented session-based car history tracking to prevent repetition (tracks last 10 cars per session)

## Feature Requests ðŸ”® FUTURE

- ðŸ”® **Also should have option to create an account or maybe play against a friend** - User accounts and multiplayer features

- ðŸ”® **Had a mess about and wow I am garbage hahaha, It's a fun wee game, nice work. Only thing I'd say is the ui on the first page, I'd make it a 2 step process** - UI simplification (difficulty first, then game mode)
